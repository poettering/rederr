# rederr

`rederr` is a small tool that invokes another command and propagates its stdout as-is and its stderr in ANSI red.

Just prefix any command line of your choice with `rederr` and it will make it easy for to figure out what is error and what is output.

Example:

## Building:

First ensure you have the `meson` and `ninja` binaries installed, as well as the
required C compiler (`gcc`) and related tools.

Run `meson build` in the project root directory.
Next change into the build directory with `cd build/`
Finally run `ninja` in that directory.
You should now have a `rederr` binary which you can copy to your `$PATH`.

Example:

```console
james@computer:~/code/src/rederr$ meson build
